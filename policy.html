      jetJump is a free, offline mobile game developed with a strong respect for your privacy.
      This app is designed to be played without an internet connection and does not require you to sign in,
      create an account, or provide any personal information. We do not collect, store, or share any data from users â€” not during installation, gameplay, or at any other point.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game does not request any device permissions. It does not access your camera, microphone, contacts,
      location, storage, or any other sensitive features on your device. You can enjoy the full functionality
      of the game entirely offline, without needing to connect to the internet.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not use any analytics tools, advertising networks, or third-party services of any kind.
      No information is sent to external servers, and there are no background processes tracking your behavior
      or device information. The app runs entirely on your device, and no data is transmitted or monitored in any form.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we do not collect any user data, there is nothing stored, processed, or shared.
      Your privacy is fully preserved, and you can use the app with confidence knowing that your personal
      information and device data remain untouched.
    </p>

    <p>
      This privacy policy reflects the current state of the app. However, it may be updated from time to time
      to reflect changes in app features, legal requirements, or other operational considerations.
      If we make any changes, we will update this document with a new effective date. You are encouraged to review
      this policy periodically to stay informed of any updates.
    </p>
